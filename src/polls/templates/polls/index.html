<!-- 
I'm not sure i like this.
Is it that hard to just go with the normal stylesheet href tag?
I'm sure this can't be the only reason to use this over the alternative that's already present on plain html.
Everything is already encapsulated inside an "app" so wouldn't somehting like:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../static/polls/style.css" /> already work?
Like, it could even have less text if i removed the whole namespacing thing.
So that they could be just one folder away from each other.

{% load static %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}">
{% if latest_question_list %}
<ul>
    {% for question in latest_question_list %}
    <li>
        <a href="{% url "polls:detail" question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% else %}
<p>No polls are available.</p>
{% endif %}
